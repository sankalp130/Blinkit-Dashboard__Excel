This analysis leverages key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations to uncover insights into sales performance. Using **Total Sales** (overall revenue), **Average Sales** (revenue per sale), **Number of Items** (items sold), and **Average Rating** (customer feedback), we explored various aspects of sales dynamics.
Visualizations helped analyze the impact of fat content on total sales and evaluate the performance of different item types. Sales were compared across outlets segmented by fat content to identify patterns. Additionally, we assessed how the age and type of outlet establishments influence total sales, examined the correlation between outlet size and revenue, and analyzed the geographic distribution of sales across locations. A comprehensive view of all metrics was provided, breaking down performance by outlet type for actionable insights.
